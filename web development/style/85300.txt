		I cannot quite understand how you came to act as you did in the court today. Nor how you can put a case against the child with such particular forces, missing no opportunity that you were put child the cease to make the poor child appear guilty of the theft. You may say that, without the evidence of the gentlemen whose purse was taken and without knowing the statements of the other gentlemen who said that they saw the child put her hand into the old gentlemen who said that they saw child put her hand into the old gentlmen pocket. There would certainly have been no case for the jury. But, surely, according to the evidence of the guard called by the defence there was a more than doubt that the prisoner was the child seen by the gentlemen who testified. The guard told a state forward tale and though you try to shake his evidence you failed to do so, expect towards the hand when he admit he saw the gold coin apparently drop from the child hands to the ground. I think you were a little sure with the guard, and I was glad when the people in the court his final reply.  Other child with him too at the end of the case no protest by him and his friends. I did not believe the poor child came out of the yard as stated one of your witnesses, and indeed  I did not believe a word of this witness evidence      bad spirit in a doing which seen a  suring through everyone in the court. I think that he is a selfish, I know that atleast a third of his story about the school and whether instructiion was receiveds untrue.
